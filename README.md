# Movie_Recommendation

This repository contains the code and data for a simple movie recommendation system. The system leverages vectorization techniques and various Python libraries to recommend movies based on their similarity to a user's input.

The movie recommendation system is designed to suggest movies that are similar to a given movie title. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to compute the similarity between movie descriptions and recommends movies that are closest in terms of content.

To represent the movie descriptions numerically, the system uses vectorization techniques. The TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library is employed to convert the text data into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors.
The cosine similarity metric is used to compute the similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of the movie descriptions. This helps in finding movies that are most similar to the input movie.
